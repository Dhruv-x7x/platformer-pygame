# A Platformer Game made in Python using Pygame

This project was completed watching DaFluffyPotato's amazing [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2gABYM5M0ww) where he made this game. I added new functionality, created my own levels, made my own art and added my own music to it. I had great fun doing this project and learned a whole lot about developing game using python. I continued my learning by creating games completely on my own and also move on to Raylib C to go even deeper into game development and learning about OpenGL.
